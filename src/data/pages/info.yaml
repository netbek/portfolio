  ## 2024⁠–present: Siyavula Foundation

  Front-end lead, full-stack and data engineering.

  ## 2016⁠–2023: Siyavula Education

  I helped to create educational software for Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, and monitoring and evaluation tools for teachers.

  As front-end lead, I was a bridge between designers and developers:

  * Set the technical direction of the front-end stack.
  * Created and maintained the colour palette, icon sets, UI components (both SSR and CSR), style guide, SSG for static pages, build scripts, and configurations of code quality tools.
  * Unified 3 legacy themes and migrated page templates in parallel with new feature development.
  * Worked with the product manager on software requirements and solution design.
  * Created low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity mockups for mobile and desktop devices.
  * Guided front-end implementation by the full-stack team.
  * Conducted functional, non-functional and cross-browser testing.
  * Provided engineering perspective in high-level product meetings.
  * Explored new approaches and technologies that improved productivity and modernised the stack.

  I also branched out into back-end development and data reporting:

  * Created and maintained API endpoints for the front-end.
  * Integrated third-party libraries and services.
  * Wrote unit tests for and refactored parts of the application.
  * Peer-reviewed the full-stack team's code.
  * Created and maintained reports and dashboards for classroom and in-house use.
  * Reviewed and optimised data models and queries.
  * Set up and maintained the data analysis stack.
  * Worked with the data analysis team on integrating their code into the back-end.

  ## 2002⁠–2015: Freelance

  I worked both independently and within agency teams, and often took on multiple roles as designer, front-end developer, back-end developer and technical support person.

  * Built 18 websites for small businesses, including broadcast media consultancies, guest houses, an architecture firm, an art gallery, an event agency and a radio station.
  * Built 12 marketing websites for renowned brands, such as PUMA, BlackBerry, Standard Bank, Castrol, Spur, 5FM and Metro FM.
  * Built 8 websites for magazines and online communities that ranged from creative writing and visual arts to music and urbanism.
  * Built a web framework and content management system, and provided maintenance and support to clients for 8 years. Subsequently, switched to Drupal for 5 years.

  ## 2002⁠–2014: Liquid Fridge

  I was [a co-founder and an organiser of a community](/work/liquid-fridge-2003-2010) that sought to develop South African arts through fostering interaction and mutual support.

  Our work included a blog, a forum, newsletters, workshops, film screenings, radio music programmes and club nights, and featured musicians, artists and technologists from South Africa and abroad.
