  ## Present

  I work as a front-end developer at [Siyavula Education](http://siyavulaeducation.com), helping to
  create high-quality learning experiences in Mathematics and Physical Sciences.

  As part of a small team, I lead front-end development, create and maintain UI components,
  and guide and review front-end work by the full-stack team. Sometimes,
  I design and develop admin and reporting dashboards, and data visualisations, too.

  _Stack: React, Redux, Vega, Node.js, Python, Pyramid, Pandas_

  ## Past

  Previously, I was a freelance web developer for 14 years, and
  [organised creative swapmeets](/work/liquid-fridge-2003-2010) that combined academia, art, and
  free culture.

  I worked solo and in agency teams, and often took on multiple roles as designer, front- and
  back-end developer, and technical support. I built and maintained websites of online and print
  magazines, broadcast media consultants, radio stations, an art gallery, an architecture firm,
  an event agency, guest houses, and various other small businesses. I also worked on integrated
  marketing campaigns for PUMA, BlackBerry, Standard Bank, Castrol, Spur, 5FM, Metro FM, and other
  large brands.

  _Stack: PHP, Drupal, Kohana, AngularJS, Node.js, ActionScript_

  ## Open source software

  My profiles on [GitHub](https://github.com/netbek) and
  [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/user/636644) list a few side projects in Node.js,
  AngularJS and Drupal that anyone is free to use or improve upon.
