  ## 2016⁠–2023

  At [Siyavula Education](http://siyavulaeducation.com), I helped to create educational software for Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, and monitoring and evaluation tools for teachers.

  As front-end lead, I was a bridge between designers and developers, and set the technical direction of the front-end stack. I created and maintained the colour palette, icon sets, UI components, style guide and build tooling. I worked with the product manager on software requirements and mockups, designed responsive UI layouts, guided implementation by the full-stack team, and did functional and non-functional testing. I gave engineering perspective in high-level product meetings, and explored new approaches and technologies that improved productivity and modernised the stack.

  I also branched out into back-end development and specialised in data reporting. I integrated third-party libraries and services, wrote unit tests for and refactored parts of the application, and conducted peer review of the full-stack team's code. I created and maintained reports and dashboards for classroom and in-house use, reviewed and optimised data models and queries, set up and maintained the data analysis stack, and worked with the data analysis team on integrating their contributions into the back-end.

  ## 2002⁠–2015

  I was a freelance web developer and [organised events that combined academia and art](/work/liquid-fridge-2003-2010).

  I worked both independently and within agency teams, and often took on multiple roles as designer, front-end developer, back-end developer and technical support person. I built and maintained websites of online and print magazines, broadcast media consultants, radio stations, an art gallery, an architecture firm, an event agency, guest houses and other small businesses. I also worked on marketing campaigns for PUMA, BlackBerry, Standard Bank, Castrol, Spur, 5FM, Metro FM and other large brands.
