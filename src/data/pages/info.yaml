  ## 2016⁠–2023

  At [Siyavula Education](http://siyavulaeducation.com), I helped to create high-quality learning experiences in Mathematics and Physical Sciences, and monitoring and evaluation tools for teachers.

  As lead front-end developer, I set the technical direction for the front-end stack, provided engineering perspective in high-level product meetings, and explored new approaches and technologies. I created and maintained UI components, guided and reviewed front-end work by the full-stack team, and did QA testing.

  For 5 years, I also did back-end development, specialising in data analytics. I designed and implemented reports and dashboards for classroom and internal use, and reviewed and productionised contributions by the data analysis team.

  ## 2002⁠–2015

  I was a freelance web developer and [organised creative swapmeets](/work/liquid-fridge-2003-2010) that combined academia, art, and free culture.

  I worked solo and in agency teams, and often took on multiple roles as designer, front- and back-end developer, and technical support. I built and maintained websites of online and print magazines, broadcast media consultants, radio stations, an art gallery, an architecture firm, an event agency, guest houses, and various other small businesses. I also worked on integrated marketing campaigns for PUMA, BlackBerry, Standard Bank, Castrol, Spur, 5FM, Metro FM, and other large brands.
