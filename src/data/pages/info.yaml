  ## Present

  I work as a front-end developer at [Siyavula Education](http://siyavulaeducation.com), helping to
  create high-quality learning experiences in Mathematics and Physical Sciences, and monitoring and
  evaluation tools for teachers.

  Since 2016, I lead front-end development, creating and maintaining UI components, guiding and
  reviewing front-end work by our full-stack team, and QA testing. My focus has expanded to include
  full-stack development: designing and implementing reports and dashboards for classroom and
  internal use, and reviewing contributions from our data analysis team.

  _Stack: JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Python, Pandas, PostgreSQL, Vega_

  ## Past

  Previously, I was a freelance web developer for 14 years, and
  [organised creative swapmeets](/work/liquid-fridge-2003-2010) that combined academia, art, and
  free culture.

  I worked solo and in agency teams, and often took on multiple roles as designer, front- and
  back-end developer, and technical support. I built and maintained websites of online and print
  magazines, broadcast media consultants, radio stations, an art gallery, an architecture firm,
  an event agency, guest houses, and various other small businesses. I also worked on integrated
  marketing campaigns for PUMA, BlackBerry, Standard Bank, Castrol, Spur, 5FM, Metro FM, and other
  large brands.

  _Stack: PHP, Drupal, Kohana, AngularJS, Node.js, ActionScript_

  ## Open source software

  My profiles on [GitHub](https://github.com/netbek) and
  [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/user/636644) list a few side projects in Node.js,
  AngularJS and Drupal that anyone is free to use or improve upon.
