  ## 2016⁠–2023

  At [Siyavula Education](http://siyavulaeducation.com), I helped to create high-quality learning experiences in Mathematics and Physical Sciences, and monitoring and evaluation tools for teachers.

  As front-end lead, I was a bridge between designers and developers. I set the technical direction of the front-end stack, worked with the product manager on software requirements and mockups, guided implementation by the full-stack team, and explored new approaches and technologies. I gave engineering perspective in high-level product meetings, created and maintained the UI components and the style guide, set up and maintained the build tooling, and did functional and non-functional testing.

  I also branched out into back-end development, specialising in data reporting. I implemented and maintained reports and dashboards for classroom and internal use, reviewed and optimised data models and queries, set up and maintained the data analysis stack, and worked with the data analysis team on integrating their contributions into the back-end.

  ## 2002⁠–2015

  I was a freelance web developer and [organised creative swapmeets](/work/liquid-fridge-2003-2010) that combined academia, art, and free culture.

  I worked solo and in agency teams, and often took on multiple roles as designer, front- and back-end developer, and technical support. I built and maintained websites of online and print magazines, broadcast media consultants, radio stations, an art gallery, an architecture firm, an event agency, guest houses, and various other small businesses. I also worked on marketing campaigns for PUMA, BlackBerry, Standard Bank, Castrol, Spur, 5FM, Metro FM, and other large brands.
