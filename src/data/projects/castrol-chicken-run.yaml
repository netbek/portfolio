title: Castrol Chicken Run (2008)
body: >-
  The wildest car race on the radio, ever. In honour of JJ McClure (*Cannonball
  Run 1981*), they put up a bounty and invited like-minded free spirits to break
  from the monotony of their lives, take the car and hit the open road. The 2008
  website is presented here. I also created the 2007 version.
