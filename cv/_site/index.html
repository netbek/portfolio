  I helped to create educational software for Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, and monitoring and evaluation tools for teachers.

  
    <p>As front-end lead, I was a bridge between designers and developers.</p>
    <ul>
      
        <li>Set the technical direction of the front-end stack.</li>
      
        <li>Created and maintained the colour palette, icon sets, UI components, style guide and build tooling.</li>
      
        <li>Worked with the product manager on software requirements and mockups.</li>
      
        <li>Designed responsive UI layouts.</li>
      
        <li>Guided implementation by the full-stack team.</li>
      
        <li>Did functional and non-functional testing.</li>
      
        <li>Gave engineering perspective in high-level product meetings.</li>
      
        <li>Explored new approaches and technologies that improved productivity and modernised the stack.</li>
      
    </ul>
  
    <p>I also branched out into back-end development and specialised in data reporting.</p>
    <ul>
      
        <li>Integrated third-party libraries and services.</li>
      
        <li>Wrote unit tests for and refactored parts of the application.</li>
      
        <li>Conducted peer review of the full-stack team&#39;s code.</li>
      
        <li>Created and maintained reports and dashboards for classroom and in-house use.</li>
      
        <li>Reviewed and optimised data models and queries.</li>
      
        <li>Set up and maintained the data analysis stack.</li>
      
        <li>Worked with the data analysis team on integrating their contributions into the back-end.</li>
      
    </ul>
